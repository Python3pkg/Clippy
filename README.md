# Clippy

Polygon clipping in pure Python. Various implementations including Kim-Kim's degeneracy extension of Greiner-Horman, an abondoned version of the Forster-Overfelt extension of G&H (after discovering their proposed algorithm was flawed to begin with), and Martinez et al. Partly for educational purposes and partly for portable pure-Python clipping. 

## Status
No high-level user API yet. Implementations are roughly complete, but seem to contain mistakes as none of the algorithms work correctly. Lots of debugging needed.
